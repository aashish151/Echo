 <p class="text-left" style="font-size: 2vmax;">The Echo has been met with nothing but constant support from the school since the very beginning. We are deeply honoured to have such a welcoming set of people at school who have helped us every step of the way. CHIREC International school is a second home to all of us, so here are some words of inspiration and kindness from its family.
<br><br>
   <b>Aneesha Ma’am:</b>
<br>
Assistant Director of CHIREC.<br>
The Echo is an exciting, student-led initiative that shares important news & events, presents a perspective into student lives and provides a platform to share one’s thoughts, opinions and ideas. It is an important and much-needed resource for students, parents, teachers and staff to learn about what is going on in school, in the community and in the world, and to learn about these from the students themselves. It takes a great deal of hard work and commitment to organise article writing, photo-journaling, designing, producing and publishing for newspapers. Congratulations on your first edition of the newspaper, on creating an engaged community, and your success!
<br><br>
<b>Trishanya Ma’am:</b>
<br><br>
  A school paper is essential for one standout reason. It gives a voice to a school’s most important stakeholders: it’s students. Student journalism yields unique and critical content that highlights the diverse perspectives of what matters to students. In the spirit of free speech, I hope The Echo will be a platform for members of the CHIREC community to debate different ideas, comment on important issues, and build bridges between different stakeholders of the CHIREC community through thoughtful, engaging, and ethical content. Congratulations to the entire team at The Echo for the hard work they’ve put into getting the paper, and this first edition, off the ground!
<br><br><br>

Dear ECHO Team,<br>
I am extremely excited for all of you at ECHO. To actualize what was just an idea, convincing the concerned Heads to give you the nod, constructing the foundation to set the work in progress, getting the team together, identifying their contributing strengths, designing the look, gleaning content, You are nothing less of a publishing house!
<br><br>I am even more excited about what I will get to read month after month. With the youth of CHIREC finding a platform to express themselves, I look forward to reading works of heightened imaginations, thoughts of serious ponderings, humour to stay on the page longer, personal achievements that would inspire and one page dedicated totally to student problems that we together can find solutions to.
<br><br>When reviews and feedback start to pour in, take them seriously. Your first isn’t going to be the best, but your best is soon to come. I wish ECHO all the best, long life and may every inbox it enters be opened and starred as a favourite!

Dear Readers,<br>
The thing that makes the human world different from all others, is our imagination, the ability to take seemingly useless objects and creating something of beauty, of grace and of utility. That spirit of innovation and discovery, that thirst for knowledge and adventure, is what makes the human being magnificent. I hope and look forward to seeing this very spirit being “echoed” in this publication. The joy of seeing one’s creativity come to fruition is incomparable. Wishing the team all the best in their endeavour, and let the fun begin!
